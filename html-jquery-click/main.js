  // YOUR CODE HERE
  // Do **_not_** use a separate closure variable to keep track of the count.
  // You must use jQuery to access the current count in the div every time you wish to modify it
  // If it is convenient, you can assign the count value read via jQuery to a variable within the function that reads and modifys it's value
