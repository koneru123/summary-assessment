## HTML/jQuery Click
The included index.html contains two buttons and a div.
* [ ] DO NOT MODIFY THE HTML.
* [ ] In 'main.js', write a script that updates the count when a button is clicked
* [ ] The upvote button should increase the count by one
* [ ] The downvote button should decrease the count by one
* [ ] **NOTE** Do **_not_** use a separate, closure variable to keep track of the count
* [ ] You must use jQuery to access the current count in the div every time you wish to modify it
* [ ] If it is convenient, you can assign the count value read via jQuery to a variable within the function that reads and modifys it's value
